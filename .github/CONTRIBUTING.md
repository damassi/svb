Thanks for taking the time to contribute to `svb`!!! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ‘Œ ðŸ’ª

Feel free to [file issues](https://github.com/himynameisdave/svb/issues/new) if you encounter any bugs, or if you have a good idea for a new feature. Try to include as much information as possible, including details about what versions of Node and this package that you are using.

If you're feeling more adventurous, a [pull request](https://github.com/himynameisdave/svb/compare) would be very welcomed! In lieu of a formal style, please try to maintain clean code, and include unit tests to cover any new functionality you are adding.
